# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React up and running.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Instruction

Run code for developing mode:

npm run dev

Do build for production code:

npm run build

## Code formatting

Often, people make mistakes. To improve the coding experience, we should use code formatting. JSPrettier & ESLint come to help us with it. These tools can detect potential and real errors in just a couple of milliseconds.

## JSPrettier configuration

Run the cli command for formatting code

```
npm run prettier
```

## ESLint configuration

Run the cli command for detect erorrs

```
npm run lint
```
