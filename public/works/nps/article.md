## Discover America’s natural treasures – offline, interactive, and augmented

The NPS mobile app is the official application of the U.S. National Park Service, designed to help users explore the country's vast collection of national parks, monuments, and historic sites. It offers rich content, interactive maps, and real-time information - all in one intuitive experience.

Whether you're planning a road trip, hiking through the Grand Canyon, or learning about wildlife at Yellowstone, the app provides essential tools and information. Even in areas with no signal, visitors can access park maps, points of interest, events, and safety alerts thanks to offline functionality.

## Our role in the project

One of our senior iOS developers, now part of the iOSMates team, contributed to this high-impact project as a member of the engineering team prior to the company's founding.
Their experience is now part of the expertise we bring to clients.

Here’s what was delivered by a member of our current team, whose experience is now part of iOSMates’ capabilities:

### Offline accessibility

Many U.S. national parks have limited or no internet coverage.
We developed a robust offline mode using CoreData that stores all essential park data - including maps, trails, events, and alerts - directly on the user’s device.

### Smart location features

The app can detect the user's current park using GPS, even in the background. Based on location, it delivers personalized notifications - like safety tips, event updates, or park-specific regulations.

### Powerful search functionality

Users can easily search for parks by name, activity, or geographic region. The search works seamlessly even when offline, making trip planning and on-the-go discovery frictionless.

### AR and enhanced exploration

With ARKit and SceneKit, users can access augmented reality features that help visualize their surroundings and understand their spatial orientation - including keeping a safe distance from wildlife.

### Data-driven improvement

We integrated Google Analytics to track how visitors use the app.
This gives park authorities insight into user behavior and helps them continuously improve the digital experience.

## Why this matters

We understand that when you're looking for a technology partner, you're not just looking for skills - you're looking for reliability, real experience, and proof that things actually get done.

This project reflects the practical, field-tested knowledge our team brings with them - not just theoretical know-how, but the kind of insight only earned through building real solutions under real pressure.

And perhaps what matters most: the very same developer who contributed to this nationally recognized app is now part of your team when you choose iOSMates.

Whether you're building a tourism app, an interactive map solution, or a product that requires seamless offline access - **you’ll benefit from the kind of expertise that already made an impact at a national level.**
