## Enabling digital healthcare - real-time, reliable, and mobile

**Appotek** is a comprehensive telehealth platform that connects patients with doctors for real-time medical consultation, diagnostics, and remote monitoring. Designed to work across both online and offline environments, the app supports health data tracking, remote device integration, appointment scheduling, and secure communication - all in a single mobile-first solution.

The application features two interconnected modules:

- **Patient** – find doctors, record vitals, schedule appointments, and manage prescriptions
- **Doctor** – monitor multiple patients, view health trends, conduct online checkups, and provide care in real time

## Our role in the project

Appotek is a long-term project that required both innovation and discipline. We joined the iOS development team in 2019 and have been continuously contributing since - balancing legacy code maintenance with new feature development, and steadily migrating the platform from Objective-C to Swift.

Here’s what we’ve been responsible for:

**Modernizing a large legacy codebase**

The app was originally built in Objective-C. We've been actively rewriting key components in Swift, improving maintainability and future-proofing the platform.

**Feature development & continuous delivery**

From health vitals recording to AI-driven diagnostic alerts, we developed and integrated complex features that work seamlessly alongside existing systems.

**Viatom medical device integration**

We connected Bluetooth-enabled medical devices using CoreBluetooth, handling data synchronization and real-time health metric visualization directly in the app.

**VoIP audio & video call setup**

Built secure doctor-patient communication features including messaging, voice calls, and group video calls, all triggered by VoIP push notifications.

**Offline support with auto-sync**

Ensured that users can access and update their data even without internet. Changes sync automatically when the connection is restored.

**Cross-platform alignment**

We closely coordinated with the web and Android teams to ensure feature consistency, data integrity, and UI/UX parity across platforms.

## Why this matters

Healthcare apps leave no room for error. Every decision - from architecture to user flow - must balance performance, privacy, and reliability. At iOSMates, we’re proud that our developers have been trusted for years to help evolve a platform that affects real lives daily.

Whether you’re building a medical app, a secure communication system, or a data-sensitive platform, Appotek proves that our team doesn’t just ship code - we stay in for the long haul and make sure it works.
