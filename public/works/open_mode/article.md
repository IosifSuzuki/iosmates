## Secure your goods - connect physical products to Web3

**Open Mode** is a Web3-powered solution that enhances product authenticity, builds consumer trust, and protects against counterfeiting. Through NFC and blockchain integration, the app helps brands create secure, tamper-proof digital identities for physical products.

Using the iOS app, registered users can generate encrypted NFC tags that are bound to a product and stored as NFTs on an external blockchain-backed server. These tags hold critical data such as product origin, price history, and ownership records - instantly accessible with a simple scan.


## Our role in the project

We joined Open Mode in mid-2024 to build out the iOS application and implement secure NFC functionality with Web3 logic.

Here’s what we delivered:

### Custom NFC label integration

Developed a specialized Swift library to manage NFC encoding for labels like NTag 424, 213, and 215 - keeping the code modular and adaptable to future label types.

### Card creation logic

Engineered the front-end logic for creating and updating both personal and business cards, ensuring a smooth user experience across different use cases.

### Web3-ready tag initialization

Built functionality to write secure data to physical NFC tags and simultaneously store the item’s identity as an NFT on the external blockchain-backed server.

### User-gated access & encryption

Integrated access control to ensure only authorized users can configure tags. Each tag is encrypted and protected against tampering.

## Why this matters

In the era of digital ownership, consumers expect transparency and traceability. Open Mode gives brands the tools to meet those expectations - and the iOS app we built is a key part of that.

Whether you're working in luxury goods, collectibles, or digital-physical experiences, Open Mode proves that our team knows how to work with NFC, encryption, and blockchain - not as buzzwords, but as practical, secure tools for product innovation.
