# CoBook

## Platform: iOS

## Technologies:

- UIKit

## Share who you are - personally and professionally

**CoBook** is a smart contact-sharing app designed to help users create, manage, and share their personal or business cards.
 
Whether networking at events or connecting with someone nearby, users can discover others based on location, interests, or needs - and instantly share their digital cards via QR codes or deep links.


## Our role in the project

Our team was responsible for a full UI/UX redesign of the mobile app to align with new product goals, improve usability, and modernize the visual style - all while maintaining compatibility with the existing backend.

Here’s what we delivered:

### Seamless onboarding

Implemented a fast and user-friendly registration flow using SMS-based phone verification - no passwords or email required.

### Card creation logic

Engineered the front-end logic for creating and updating both personal and business cards, ensuring a smooth user experience across different use cases.


### Efficient backend integration

Despite significant design changes, we avoided any backend modifications - saving the client time and budget while still achieving the desired product upgrade.

### Smart sharing and deep linking

Enabled deep link recognition and link decoding, allowing users to open shared cards directly from a URL or QR code and navigate to the correct in-app screen instantly.

## Why this matters

We understand that when you're trusting someone with your product, it's not just about writing code. It's about making the right decisions under constraints, solving real problems, and doing so in a way that respects your time, your users, and your budget.

In the CoBook project, our team didn’t just redesign a UI. We rethought the experience without disrupting what already worked. We found ways to modernize and simplify, while keeping development efficient and backend untouched. These are the kinds of thoughtful choices that define real-world success.

And while CoBook focused on digital identity and contact sharing, the mindset we brought to it applies across industries. Whether you're building tools for health, education, e-commerce, or tourism, we bring the same commitment: practical thinking, resource-aware planning, and reliable delivery.

You’re tapping into experience that’s already done the hard part.
